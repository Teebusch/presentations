## My First R Package

*Nordic RSE get together, December 2nd 2020, online [(link)](https://nordic-rse.org/events/2020-online-get-together/my-first-r-package/)*

This talk is about how writing an R package has helped me leave my comfort zone and level up my R programming skills. The code I write as a researcher is mostly single-user and single-use. Writing and publishing code meant for others has helped me break old habits and get a better grasp of software engineering. R has a very streamlined ecosystem for package development that makes understanding and following best practices easy. I will talk about the things I have learned, why I think writing a package should be a rite of passage for any aspiring research software engineer, and why R is a great tool for this.

## Workshop: Data Visualization Design

*9 January 2020, Uio Research Bazaar, University of Oslo, Norway [(link)](https://www.ub.uio.no/english/courses-events/events/all-libraries/2020/research-bazaar/visualisation.html)*

**Co-hosted with Désirée Treichler**

*Slides available on request*

In this workshop we will approach data visualization as a design problem, and learn how to solve this problem systematically. You will learn cognitive and design principles that help you understand what works and why, and how to explore different design solutions more efficiently.

Good data visualization will help you tell the story of your research and make your papers and presentations stand out. Yet, most researchers are never really taught how to visualize data. Instead, their design process is based on intuition, copying others, and try-and-error. This is a waste of time and often produces ineffective results.

In this workshop we will approach data visualization as a design problem, and learn how to solve this problem more systematically. You will see why visualization is a powerful way to communicate your data. You will learn design principles that help you understand what works and why, and practice hands-on how to explore design solutions more efficiently.

#### Learning outcomes

Participants will:

- Learn about the value of data visualization and when and why to visualize data.
- Learn about the hidden thinking behind good data visualization: understanding the context of the visualization (e.g., audience, presentation format) and how to use editorial thinking to decide what to show.
- Learn how to approach a data set for visualization, e.g., understand different types of data and the implications for visual encoding.
- Learn about different ways to encode data visually, and understand how data can be encoded more effectively by following basic principles of perception and visual design (e.g., signal detection theory, Gestalt laws)
- Understand the different elements of a chart and how to use them to make more effective visualizations (e.g., annotations, color, composition)

We will focus on explanatory data visualizations (e.g., for posters and presentations) and relatively simple types of data that can be found across most disciplines. We will *not* cover exploratory data analysis, bespoke data visualizations for scientific discovery, domain-specific data types (e.g., text, networks, high-dimensional data), algorithms (e.g., dimensionality reduction, clustering), or advanced visualization techniques (e.g., interaction, animation).

#### Prerequisites

No programming experience is required (and no artistic ability is required, either). However, you should be familiar with fundamental statistical concepts and chart types.

#### Target audience

The course is for researchers and graduate students who want to communicate their research more effectively, for example in papers, posters, presentations, or to the general public. Generally, it may be useful to anyone who uses data to inform, support decision making, and motivate change.

## Workshop: Let's build an Augmented Reality Web App!

- *8 January 2020, UiO Research Bazaar, University of Oslo, Norway [(link)](https://www.ub.uio.no/english/courses-events/events/all-libraries/2020/research-bazaar/webapp.html)*
- *15 December 2019, KoLab Hackerspace, Mechelen, Belgium [(link)](https://www.meetup.com/Ko-Lab-mechelen/events/266161193/)*

Augmented reality (AR) apps add a virtual layer on top of the real world. This allows you to catch Pokémon in your backyard, but it also has serious potential for hacking your environment: You can use AR to share information where it is most useful, create fantastic experiences that merge the real and the virtual, or simply label your storage cabinets in the nerdiest way possible. Once you know how to augment the real world, the options are endless—and it is a lot easier than you think!

In this workshop we will learn how to place virtual objects and annotations in the real world, so that they can be seen using a smartphone as a 'magic window'. We will learn how to animate things, how to add interactivity, and how to get data into AR. Finally, there will be a mini-hackathon where you use your new skills to build the AR web app of your (humble) dreams.

We will build everything with open source web technology. All you need is a computer with a browser. The app will be hosted online and will run in any modern browser. The user will need only a smartphone to use it—no installation required.

#### In this workshop you will …

- Learn how to use the A-Frame JavaScript framework to create 3D scenes for browser-based VR and AR, how to add and style text, simple 3D shapes, and pre-created 3D models, and how to add animation and interactivity.

- Get a basic understanding of how to bind data to A-Frame objects in order to create data-driven AR experiences.

- Learn how to turn an A-frame scene into an AR app, how to use AR markers to anchor AR objects in the real world, and how to use QR codes to make accessing your app seamless.

At the end of the workshop you will have a functioning AR app that will be hosted on the internet.

This course is for anyone who wants to take their first steps with creating augmented reality experiences. It will be beginner-friendly. Most of the code we write will be relatively simple HTML and JavaScript. You do not need experience with HTML or JavaScript, but some programming experience is highly recommended.


The code for this workshop lives [in its own repository](https://github.com/Teebusch/arworkshop). The workshop uses [this repl.it](https://repl.it/@Teebusch/arworkshop).
There are a handful of [slides on Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1w6RXi930NecEbSmyv7L5u3LIiuqUiUfcP-Kfew72AvU/edit?usp=sharing).

## Coursework

### What Makes a Difference?

*April 2020, nowhere*

In 'What Makes a Difference?' beschäftige ich mit der Frage was eine Differenz, einen Unterschied, ausmacht. Es ist ein kurzes visuelles Essay inspiriert von den Werken Scott McClouds und Nick Sousanis‘.
Differenzen begegnen uns auf vielen Ebenen: Die Aufrechterhaltung der Differenz von Innen und Außen ist oberstes Ziel unseres Körpers. In der Gesellschaft sind es die 'feinen Unterschiede', die die Menschen, gerade wegen ihrer Feinheit, nahezu unüberwindlich voneinander trennen. In der Wissenschaft gilt der "significant difference" als der erbrachte Beweis.
In 'What Makes a Difference?' betrachte ich Differenz aus der Sicht der Kognitionswissenschaft. Ich zeige, dass Differenzen manchmal 'just noticeable' sind, dass sie unsere Neuronen automatisch feuern lassen, dass wir Differenzen sehen wo keine sind, und keine Differenzen sehen wo sie existieren. Ich komme zu dem Schluss, dass es das Gehirn ist, dass den Unterschied macht.
Die Umsetzung ist minimalistisch und auf das wesentliche reduziert. Dies ist zum einen zeitlichen und technischen Beschränkungen geschuldet, zum anderen erinnert es an die Ästhetik wahrnehmungspsychologischer Experimente, in denen alles nicht Essenzielle entfernt wird bis nur noch das übrig bleibt, was zum Testen der Hypothese erforderlich ist. Statt eines Buchformats oder einer Infografik im Posterformat handelt es sich um das einer PowerPoint-Präsentation was ebenfalls an eine wissenschaftliche Präsentation erinnert.

### Design Thinking and Making

*2018, KU Leuven*

These presentations were for a course on Design Thinking and Making. The course was centered around critical design for the library of the future. These are the slides I made as part of the course assignments.

### Journal Club: Bayesian Growth Curve Modeling 

*July 19th 2017, KU Leuven*

In this edition of the journal club we will talk about love, babies, and Bayesian statistics. The paper carefully takes us through the steps involved in specifying, fitting and summarizing a growth curve model (GCM) in a Bayesian framework. GCMs are useful in developmental research and fit naturally in the Bayesian framework. This is my first contact with Bayesian statistics and, although the paper provides a very nice introduction, it leaves a lot of questions, which I would like to discuss.

The paper we discuss is *Oravecz & Muth (2017). Fitting growth curve models in the Bayesian framework. Psychonomic Bulletin and Review*. The paper can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13423-017-1281-0). The paper's accompanying git repository is [here](https://git.psu.edu/zzo1/FittingGCMBayesian). 

*This* repository contains the slides of my presentation and my own version of the analysis. In some places the code has been adapted to be more concise.

  + The slides are in `Journal-Club-Bayes.pdf`.
  + The main part of the analysis is in the R Notebook `loveAnalysis.Rmd`. You can view a live version of it [here](http://rpubs.com/teebusch/jc-bayesgcm).
