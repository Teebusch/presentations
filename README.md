## Code and Slides for ExpORL Journal Club, July 19th 2017

The paper we will talk about is *Oravecz & Muth (2017). Fitting growth curve models in the Bayesian framework. Psychonomic Bulletin and Review*. The paper can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13423-017-1281-0). The paper's accompanying git repository is [here](https://git.psu.edu/zzo1/FittingGCMBayesian). 

*This* repository contains the slides of my presentation and my own version of the analysis. In some places the code has been adapted to be more concise.

  + The slides are in `jc-tbusch-19-7-bayesgcm.pdf`.
  + The main part of the analysis is in the R Notebook `loveAnalysis.Rmd`. You can view a live version [here](http://rpubs.com/teebusch/jc-bayesgcm).
