 ## My first R package

 *RSE get together, December 2nd 2020, online*

This talk is about how writing an R package has helped me leave my comfort zone and level up my R programming skills. The code I write as a researcher is mostly single-user and single-use. Writing and publishing code meant for others has helped me break old habits and get a better grasp of software engineering. R has a very streamlined ecosystem for package development that makes understanding and following best practices easy. I will talk about the things I have learned, why I think writing a package should be a rite of passage for any aspiring research software engineer, and why R is a great tool for this.
