 ## My First R Package

 *RSE get together, December 2nd 2020, online*

This talk is about how writing an R package has helped me leave my comfort zone and level up my R programming skills. The code I write as a researcher is mostly single-user and single-use. Writing and publishing code meant for others has helped me break old habits and get a better grasp of software engineering. R has a very streamlined ecosystem for package development that makes understanding and following best practices easy. I will talk about the things I have learned, why I think writing a package should be a rite of passage for any aspiring research software engineer, and why R is a great tool for this.

## Design Thinking and Making

*2018, KU Leuven*

These presentations were for a course on Design Thinking and Making. The course was centered around critical design for the library of the future. These are the slides I made as part of the course assignments.

## Journal Club Bayes - Code and Slides for ExpORL Journal Club 

*July 19th 2017, KU Leuven*

In this edition of the journal club we will talk about love, babies, and Bayesian statistics. The paper carefully takes us through the steps involved in specifying, fitting and summarizing a growth curve model (GCM) in a Bayesian framework. GCMs are useful in developmental research and fit naturally in the Bayesian framework. This is my first contact with Bayesian statistics and, although the paper provides a very nice introduction, it leaves a lot of questions, which I would like to discuss.

The paper we discuss is *Oravecz & Muth (2017). Fitting growth curve models in the Bayesian framework. Psychonomic Bulletin and Review*. The paper can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13423-017-1281-0). The paper's accompanying git repository is [here](https://git.psu.edu/zzo1/FittingGCMBayesian). 

*This* repository contains the slides of my presentation and my own version of the analysis. In some places the code has been adapted to be more concise.

  + The slides are in `Journal-Club-Bayes.pdf`.
  + The main part of the analysis is in the R Notebook `loveAnalysis.Rmd`. You can view a live version of it [here](http://rpubs.com/teebusch/jc-bayesgcm).
