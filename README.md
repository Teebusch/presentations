## Code and Slides for ExpORL Journal Club, July 19th 2017

In this edition of the journal club we will talk about love, babies, and Bayesian statistics. The paper carefully takes us through the steps involved in specifying, fitting and summarizing a growth curve model (GCM) in a Bayesian framework. GCMs are useful in developmental research and fit naturally in the Bayesian framework. This is my first contact with Bayesian statistics and, although the paper provides a very nice introduction, it leaves a lot of questions, which I would like to discuss.

The paper we discuss is *Oravecz & Muth (2017). Fitting growth curve models in the Bayesian framework. Psychonomic Bulletin and Review*. The paper can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13423-017-1281-0). The paper's accompanying git repository is [here](https://git.psu.edu/zzo1/FittingGCMBayesian). 

*This* repository contains the slides of my presentation and my own version of the analysis. In some places the code has been adapted to be more concise.

  + The slides are in `jc-tbusch-19-7-bayesgcm.pdf`.
  + The main part of the analysis is in the R Notebook `loveAnalysis.Rmd`. You can view a live version of it [here](http://rpubs.com/teebusch/jc-bayesgcm).
