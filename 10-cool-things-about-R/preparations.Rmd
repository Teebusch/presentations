We can have a look at the first few rows of the data with the `head()` function:

```{r}
glimpse(peaks)
```

```{r}
skimr::skim(peaks)
janitor::tabyl(peaks, climbed)
```

```{r}
peaks %>% 
  arrange(first_ascent_year) %>% 
  head()
```


```{r}
peaks %>% 
  filter(climbing_status == "Climbed") %>% 
  separate_rows(first_ascent_country, sep = ",") %>% 
  count(first_ascent_country, sort = T)
```
```{r}
peaks %>% 
  filter(climbing_status == "Unclimbed" & !is.na(first_ascent_expedition_id))
```
```{r}
expeditions %>%  filter(expedition_id == "LANY18301") %>% 
  glimpse()
```

```{r}
peaks %>% 
  group_by(climbing_status) %>% 
  skimr::skim()
```


```{r}
df <- peaks %>% 
  left_join(expeditions, by = c("first_ascent_expedition_id" = "expedition_id"))
```

```{r}
skimr::skim(df)
```

```{r}
df %>% 
  filter(climbing_status == "Unclimbed" && !is.na(expedition_id))
```

How many expeditions have failed before the first succesful ascend?

```{r}
expeditions %>% skimr::skim()
```

# Investigate Unsuccesfully climbed peaks?
